 >"That dog don't take to pettin', son." -- Hondo Lane

You are camping. A random dog has walked in from the woods surrounding you. It is October and the nights are starting to get really cold. The dog seems to have been attracted to your fire. He's a bit mangy and dirty, and he looks pretty hungry. You reach toward your leftovers; there are a few bones you could toss over from the game you've been cooking. Turning around, you find yourself face to face with a rabid raccoon! Before you can even react, the dog scares the raccoon away. You nod approvingly, toss him a bone, and he rests by the fire.

 Camp Dog is protecting you from the wild animals that surround you. He's not necessarily friendly, but as long as you toss him a bone on occasion and keep your fire going, Camp Dog will stick around. 

 ## _Game Technologies_

 If the fire is not kept up or if Camp Dog doesn't get enough bones, he will take off. However, if you manage to befriend Camp Dog for a certain amount of time--enough time to gain his trust, you will be in for a surprise!

 Get ready to befriend the wild beast that is CAMP DOG to find out more about him!
